# eBayProjectQA-Automation

**Welcome to eBay QA project**

**OVERVIEW**
Welcome to the www.ebay.com automation tests.A lot of tests were done in this project. All the tests were from the buyer's side.

**TEST CASES**
The test cases are organized by functionality, ensuring comprehensive coverage of eBay's key features. 
Each test case includes detailed steps and expected outcomes to guide the testing process.

**Configuration**
Configure the testing environment to use Selenium Grid for parallel execution:

Ensure Selenium Grid is set up and running either locally or remotely.
Configure the desired capabilities for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers.
Adjust the test scripts to connect to the Selenium Grid hub and specify browser configurations.

To run the tests you need to write 3 commands in the terminal.
terminal 2 + 3 to run selenium grid.
terminal 1 : 
pip"your python version" install selenium
in my case : pip3 install selenium

to check if the selenium is downloaded you need to write in the terminal : pip show selenium

terminal 2 : java -jar selenium-server-4.17.0.jar hub 
terminal 3 : java -jar selenium-server-4.17.0.jar node --config node1.toml

**I want to mention that GitHub hosts STP and STD documents that contain all the necessary information about the project**
